# IBCLient
Hi guys this is my Computer Science HL IA project which is a recreation of Badlion Client. 

Download to the cover_page.htm if you'd like to see the actual IA it's self.

Here are the instructions though if you'd like to try out the mod

1.Make sure Minecraft is installed

2.Run version 1.8.9 at least once before putting the files in. 

3.Open up your .minecraft folder (Usually found by running %appdata% in windows run)

4.Select the versions folder and create a new folder named IBClient (Not naming it that has caused issues so be warned)

5.Drag both the Jar and the Json file into it and close out

6.Reopn Minecaft launcher and IBClient should be a selectable version (might have to scroll around) and enjoy!!

7. Note that this "modded" minecraft is limited and has many areas for improvemnt.


IMPORTANT: 
My main source of research for set up and the code was done through Eric's Goldes youtube tutorials. If you'd like to see how I got the source code into 
my IDE(Eclipse) and how to begin the process of adding your own mods in please check it out!
